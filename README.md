## Motivation
* Federated Learning is a popular machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
parties to collaboratively train a joint (global) neural network without exposing their private data.
However, the performance of the global model is impacted by the heterogeneity, i.e., skewness of
the data of each individual participant.

## Design goals
* Characterize the impact of heterogeneity on FL. Then do the same characterization under
adversarial conditions.

## Deliverables
* Understand federated learning and heterogeneity.
* Implement FL with different datasets and different levels of heterogeneity.
* Include some adversarial attacks and perform the same characterization.
* What do we observe in adversarial vs. non-adversarial settings? Why do we think the impact of heterogeneity is different in both settings?
* 3 datasets with altered levels of heterogeneity, repeated with adversarial attacks.
